Various python scripts that helped the paper (mostly stats about wordnets)

* nocandidates.py finds the amount of synsets with no translations in WoNeF
* badsynsets.py finds synsets without any valid candidates: it's an easy to find synsets that don't map properly to French
* reasonbads.py reads an gold standard annotated with error informations and display stats on those errors
* bestexamples.py was used for the paper to find a good meronymy example
* compareboth.py compares WOLF against WoNeF to show how large a merger would be
* mwe.py computes the number of MWE in PWN
* nbpolysemous counts the number of polysemous synsets in PWN
